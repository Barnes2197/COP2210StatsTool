# StatsTool
Programming Project
5 - Write a program that simulates a statistics tool, by letting the user determine the minimum, the
maximum, the range (maximum – minimum), the mode (value that is repeated more often), the mean
(average), and the standard deviation of a set of numbers. These numbers, that will be stored in an
array, represent salaries in the $30K – $60K range and are to be generated randomly.
This is the definition of standard deviation,
√
∑ (𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥̅)
𝑛 2
𝑖=1
𝑛 − 1
where x̄denotes the average, and n is the total number of elements in the array.
The program will present the user a menu with these choices:
- Populate Array
- Display Array
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Range
- Mode
- Mean
- Standard Deviation
- Exit
and will let the user run them until “Exit” is entered.
